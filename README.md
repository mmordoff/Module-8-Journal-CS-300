# Module-8-Journal-CS-300

1.	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was trying to solve for the projects in this course was to understand the different data structures and understand in what situation would each data structure be best used in. Using the best data structure for the desired outcome of the program will produce the best results and allow the program to run more efficiently.

2.	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by first understanding the purpose behind each data structure. I also thought about the long-term solution for each data structure. For example, for project two, I could have used another data structure besides a hash table as right now there were not a lot of courses that ABCU currently offered. However, that could change in a few years. Therefore, I used a hash table so the program would not have to start over from scratch. It is important to understand how each data structure works, the strengths and weaknesses of each in order to design the best code for you program for the desired result.

3.	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by rereading Zybooks, reaching out to peers, and sometimes walking away from the activity/project so I could approach it with a fresh mind at a later time.

4.	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This has expanded my approach on designing software and developing programs because I now know more about data structures and how to best use them. This will allow me to design my code to industry best standards and understand how to better design my code based upon the desired goal.

5.	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This course has shown me there are multiple ways to design a single program. It has caused me to think about the best way I believe the code should be designed but also the why behind it.
